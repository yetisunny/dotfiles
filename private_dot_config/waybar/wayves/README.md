# wayves

wayves is a module for bars like waybar and polybar, that shows cava and/or different animations based on chosen player status

## Installation

Requirements:

```
python
bc
cava
```

Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jvc84/wayves.git
cd wayves
mkdir ~/.config/cava
cp assets/cava/cava_option_config ~/.config/cava
```

## Important about CAVA:

You can configure number of bars, framerate etc. of the ```cava``` option in ```~/.config/cava/cava_option_config```:

```
bars = <bars>
framerate = <framerate>
...
```

 
## Information about flags and options

- If you don't set `--player/-p`, it will track ALL `mpris` players' playback 

- Also you can set this behavior with `--player any`

- See available players with `playerctl -l` (Shows only active ones)

Use ```python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py --help``` to read about flags and options

```

    waves               -    scripts of 3 bars moving up and down
    cava[=SECTION]      -    dynamic waves, that depend on sound. Requires cava

## Examples

### If you just want cava:

![plot](.doc/images/cava_example.png)

```
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava -i cava -a cava"
},
```

### If you want mini waves to move when music is on:

![plot](.doc/images/waves_example.png)

```
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -p <PLAYER> -o flat=3 -i splash -a waves"
},
```

### If you want to separate left and right cava halves to put something in between:

![plot](.doc/images/double_cava_example.png)

module for left audio channel:

```
"custom/wayves_left": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava=left -i cava=left -a cava=left"
},
```

module for right audio channel:

```
"custom/wayves_right": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava=right -i cava=right -a cava=right"
},
```

### Maybe you just want a little cat to live in your bar:

![plot](.doc/images/cat_example.png)

```
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cat -i cat -a cat"
},

```

That's pretty much it. Put star if you like this module and send bug report if something is wrong.
