            Default value is "any", which stands for detecting any mpris (playerctl) playback.   
            Unnecessary if all other flag have same value. You can get names of active players by command 'playerctl -l'  
        -o, --off  <OPTION>          -    script, that shows when player is down. 'cat' by default
        -i, --inactive   <OPTION>    -    script, that shows when player is up, but music is on pause. 'splash' by default
        -a, --active  <OPTION>       -    script, that shows when player is up, and music is playing. 'cava' by default
